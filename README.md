# •Rock Paper Scissors

[View website Here!](https://hills007.github.io/Rock-Paper-Scissors/)

•Rock paper scissors is an intransitive hand game, usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. These shapes are "rock" (a closed fist), "paper" (a flat hand), and "scissors" (a fist with the index finger and middle finger extended, forming a V). It is normally played between friends, colleagues and family to make a decision. 

•It has been shown that similar people are more likely to draw in this but playing agaist the computer has proven to be more fairer as the computer choses randomley than that played with hands.This site will be targeted towards adults and kids alike as a simple app to learn and have fun with it.

## Bugs
